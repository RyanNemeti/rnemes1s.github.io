      <p>This simulation shows how the cycle of carbon emissions will only grow until we do something to stop it. Our animation aims to encourage people to  take action against climate change.</p>

      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>This box is meant to tell the story of a forest fire that is destroying habitats and releasing carbon dioxide into the air. This forest fire is the result of climate change, which causes hotter temperatures that make environments drier. The drier environments make it so that even a spark from a campfire can turn into a deadly forest fire. However, we still have the power to stop these fires. The bucket of water represents the human race as a whole. We have the power to turn climate change around, but unlike this box it will require more than just one person pulling a fire alarm. Everyone, especially the 90 large companies who contribute to 63% of climate change, all need to work together to make the world greener."</p>
